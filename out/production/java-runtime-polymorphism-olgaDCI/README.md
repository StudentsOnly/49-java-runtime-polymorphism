## Exercise: Runtime Polymorphism - Employee Payroll

#### Objective:

Practice runtime polymorphism and method overriding in Java by creating a program to calculate the payroll for different types of employees.

#### Description:

You should create a set of classes representing different types of employees (e.g., PermanentEmployee, ContractEmployee) and calculate their payroll using method overriding. 

Each employee class should have a method called calculatePayroll that calculates and returns the employee's payroll based on their type. 

Create a class called PayrollCalculator that demonstrates the use of runtime polymorphism and overridden methods for payroll calculation.

#### Guidelines:

#### Employee Classes:

Create two classes: PermanentEmployee and ContractEmployee, each representing a different type of employee.

Each employee class should have a method calculatePayroll that calculates and returns the employee's payroll based on their type.

Implement the calculatePayroll method differently in each class. For example, a permanent employee's payroll may include a fixed salary and bonuses, while a contract employee's payroll may be based on an hourly rate and hours worked.

#### PayrollCalculator Class:

Create a class called PayrollCalculator that calculates the payroll for different types of employees.

Display the employee type and their calculated payroll.
